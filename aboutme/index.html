    <h2>Julia Lassig</h2>
    <p>Hi, I'm Julia. I am married to the man of my dreams and we have 3 amazing children.
    <p>I'm pursuing a Bachelor's of Applied Technology because I hope to break out of my current skill-set <br />and because I have so many ideas for new apps and websites.  </p>
    <p>I've been a member of the Church since I was 8. If I were to tell you how long I'd been a member, <br />then you could use simple math to figure out that I'm too old to want to to answer that question. Nice try.</p>
    <p>I've recently been in love with the scripture: Luke 1:37 "For with God nothing shall be impossible." <br />I know I can do this with His help and that He wants to help me on this exciting journey of re-inventing myself. </p>
    <ul>
        Things that I enjoy:
        <li>Long discussions into the wee hours with my family about random topics</li>
        <li>Gardening, except for during August, because it's just too hot</li>
        <li>Playing my Guitar,</li>
        <li>3D printing</li>
        <li>Eating, especially a big plate of loaded nachos. </li>
        <li>Meditating,</li>
        <li>and Lists!</li>
    </ul>
