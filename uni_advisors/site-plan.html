Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

   Content
  </h2>
  <h3>Home page</h3>
  <p>
   This first page would welcome the student to our site, have them choose a major from a list (probably an unordered list), be able to contact us if their major isn't listed, give them the company motto, have a nav bar and footer. Since I am only doing 3 pages for this project, the only "major" that the student can click on will be Applied Technology. Also, because we are only doing 3 pages, the nav bar would include home, Applied Technology and Book Now. The finished nav bar (outside of class) would not include applied technology, it would have search by advisor (where you could search by the advisor's name you want). Also, all of the major links would take you to a page similar to how Applied Technology is going to look. </p>
  <p>

   This is where I will have pictures of each advisor, along with their name, major, bio (like the experience they have in that field), languages they speak, times/days they are available.

  <h3>Book Now</h3>
  <p>
   The student can get to this page by clicking on the advisor's photo or by clicking on Book Now up at the top nav bar. In the finished (outside of class project), this page would have a drop down with the different advisors names. The student would click on that name and then that advisor's google calendar or calendly scheduler would pop up. Since that would require (I think) javascript, we are going to do it a little different for this class. There will still be a dropdown (Who doesn't love a good drop down?) with the advisors name. The only advisor that the student (in this case) can click on would be Tyler Jensen because the picture of the calendar will be fixed to Tyler Jensen. 
   One day though, I want to be able to add that the student can actually book with the person and any of the people. 
  </p>
  <p>
   Also, I want to include basic instructions for using the calendar below ("Click on the day you want, and then click on the time on the right" "Choose your time zone from the dropdown", etc.)
